# Startup Profit Prediction

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project focused on predicting profits of startups. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), implementation of Multiple Linear Regression, regularization techniques to address over-fitting, and the use of Gradient Descent for optimization. The dataset used for this project includes information about 50 startups, including their expenditures and profits.

## Data:
The dataset includes the following columns:

R&D Spend: Expenditure on Research and Development.

Administration: Administrative expenditures.

Marketing Spend: Expenditure on Marketing.

State: The state in which the startup is located.

Profit: The profit earned by the startup.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is performed to examine the hidden patterns in the dataset and extract information. This includes statistical analysis, visualizations, and insights into the relationships between different variables.
## Machine Learning Models:
Multiple Linear Regression:

Multiple Linear Regression is implemented to predict startup profits based on features like R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend.

Regularization Techniques:

Regularization techniques, such as Lasso and Ridge regression, are applied to address over-fitting and improve model performance.

Gradient Descent:

Gradient Descent, an optimization algorithm, is used to minimize the cost function and improve the accuracy of the model predictions.
